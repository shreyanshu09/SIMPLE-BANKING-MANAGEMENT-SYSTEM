# SIMPLE-BANKING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

This project is all about to make a Simple Banking Management System using socket programing in C language. The objective of this project is to implement a simple banking system for customer, administrator and for police to operate some basic functions of a bank.


In this project, first you have to run the server program then run the client program, after running the client program it will ask for username and then password. After entering correct user name and password it will check whether you are customer, admin or police and show the information accordingly and if you enter wrong username or password it will shows unauthorized user. Basically, there are three main functions which I have implemented in this project are:
Customer
Admin
Police
If you are a Customer then it will show what you want to do with your account like whether you want to know the available balance or you want to get the mini statement of your account and based on your choice it will show the information.
If you are Admin then it will first ask for the account holder’s name in which you want to do credit or debit and after entering correct username it will ask whether you want to do credit or debit and based on your choice it will ask for the amount that how much you want to credit/debit from that account after entering correct amount it will update the balance in the account holder’s account.
If you are Police then it will first ask for the account holder’s name in which you want to investigate and after entering correct username it will show what you want to do with this account like whether you want to know the available balance or you want to get the mini statement of this account and based on your choice it will show the information.
